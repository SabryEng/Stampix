# Stampix Photos Printability Project

This project is a machine learning-based application for assessing photo printability. It predicts printability scores based on some image criterias .

## Time Spent

I spent approximately 12 hours working on this project , 10 hours preparing the used simple data and 2 hours for modeling and deployment.

## Challenges and Solutions

- **Challenge 1: Dataset **
  - **Challenge:** I had to generate some images from free APIs image generators, it was limited as it is paid service so i used multiple emails to login and generate with each email some images.


- **Challenge 2: Model Training Convergence**
  - **Challenge:** The machine learning model is not well trained due to lack of data so it probably has performance issues, but it works.


## How to Run the Application

To run the Stampix Photo Printability application, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/SabryEng/Stampix
 
- Navigate to the project directory

- Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

- Run the Flask application:
python app.py


Finally, 
Open your web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000 to access the application.

Upload a photo to get a printability score and see the results.
